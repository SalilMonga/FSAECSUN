# FSAECSUN

This repo is for the Formula SAE club at CSUN. This repo is set up for experimenting with the CAN bus system.

To access code from someone specific, go to a named branch (e.g., `salil`) and checkout the branch to test. 

The main branch will be updated once we have a final structure of the codebase. But for now, each dev is working on their own branch and the code can be accessed from the respective branches.
